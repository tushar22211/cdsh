      <h2>Donation Policy</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      Donation is one of the easiest ways to help someone in need. The amount
      doesn’t have to be big – even a small donation can help in changing
      someone’s life in excellent ways. The Non-Governmental Organisations have
      been at the forefront to ensure that the ones in need are assisted for
      their issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      NGOs and charitable trusts need funding to meet the expenses. Coins
      donated by the user in Cashdoot app is converted into money and
      transferred to organization selected by the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      We take our donors privacy very seriously and ensure that their
      information is secured with us, and that, no third party source has access
      to them.
